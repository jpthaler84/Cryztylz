# Cryztylz Collector

Welcome to the mathematical journey that is Cryztylz Collector! Using Javascript, HTML, and CSS, I created a simple game where the user clicks on each gem (which is assigned a random value) and tries to match the randomly set wizard's score.

Future developments:

- Sound
- Dynamic button effects (on gems)
- Overall cleaner user experience
